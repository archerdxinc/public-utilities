# public-utilities
This repo is meant to house scripts and related utilities that may be distributed directly to customers and/or used in their Archer Analysis deployments.

Anything from 'main' should be considered acceptable to use. Do not share this repo directly with customers, but instead pull files from the main branch and send from there.

Anyone may contribute to this repo.

Pull Requests require two reviewers to ensure that:
1. Code is well-documented to understand use cases and scope (i.e. applicable Analysis versions, etc).
2. Security/privacy considerations are addressed (i.e. don't encourage storage of sensitive data such as passwords in files).
3. Code does not cause unnecessary compute, especially loops/requests that will bog down a system and/or incur significant costs.
4. Adequate testing has been performed.
